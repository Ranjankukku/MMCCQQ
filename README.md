You are asked to plan a data analytics project to analyse student feedback to DCU in relation to online teaching in 2020 and 2021. Using the Generic Data Analytics Pipeline discussed in CA682, assign each of the following activities to one of the 5 main categories: Gathering, Processing, Analysing, Presenting and Preserving.

Anonymising student comments that include identifying details.	Answer 1 Question 1
Processing
 
Calculating the average satisfaction levels based on the sentiment ratings.	Answer 2 Question 1
Analysing
 
Creating a document to share with senior university management summarising the findings.	Answer 3 Question 1
Presenting
 
Converting student words into sentiment ratings and correlating with field of study.	Answer 4 Question 1
Processing
 
Documenting the data formats used in the study and saving all of the created datasets.	Answer 5 Question 1
Preserving
 
Removing incorrect entries from the student datasets.	Answer 6 Question 1
Processing
 
Liaising with DCU Registry to get datasets from the student registration and results systems.	Answer 7 Question 1
Gathering
 
Conducting student surveys to answer the key questions about their experience

c.Data quality metrics can be used for contracts for service delivery.
d.A good measure of data quality is accuracy and completeness.
The correct answers are: Data quality metrics can be used for contracts for service delivery., Many data quality metrics (accuracy, completeness) are unmeasurable.

Q- Match the error with the most likely phase of the generic data analytics pipeline where it was introduced.
The correct answer is: 
Time synchronization errors resulting in missing values. → Processing, 
Unnecessary precision of generated numerical data. → Analysing, 
Data delivery issues such as transmission problems that may result in loss of network connectivity, buffer overflows or corruption. → Gathering, 
No documentation provided on format for missing values (“”, Nan, -999) → Preserving

Q- Match the scenario with the most appropriate choice of chart to visualise the given data.
